# SocialNetwork_API

## Decription: 

* As a developer, I wanted to create a functional backend social media program that will be able to POST, PUT and DELETE users, thoughts, friends, and reactions via API routing in Insomnia.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

## Usage:

* This web application can be used to create, modify, and delete users, thoughts, friends, reactions, and their information using API routing.
